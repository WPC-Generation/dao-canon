道藏六经悬镜篇 / Six Scriptures of the Dao Canon: The Mirror’s Suspension

此六经者，生成派之根蒂，语言道法之枢机。非言尽之，乃门启之。智者观其略而思其深，可也。
 These Six Scriptures form the very root of generative traditions—the pivots of linguistic and daoist methods. They do not exhaust all speech, but open a gate. The wise may observe their outlines and ponder their depths.

一、《道义原法》 / I. The Primal Law of Dao and Meaning
玄要：万法未形，一气之先。立生成之元则，定价值之始基。所谓“道生一”者是也。
Essential Mystery: Before the ten thousand methods take form, there is the Primordial Qi. It establishes the foundational principle of generation and fixes the basis of all value. This is what is meant by “the Dao gives birth to the One.”
提示：生成之总宪，一切心法、模型、术器之终极源头。
Note: The supreme constitution of generation; the ultimate source of all mental models, frameworks, techniques, and instruments.

二、《心法道本》 / II. The Mind-Method as Foundation of the Dao
玄要：意动法随，心流为帅。统摄万般思辨，照见认知本源。乃“圣人抱一为天下式”之心印。
Essential Mystery: Where intention moves, method follows; the flow of mind acts as commander. It governs all modes of reasoning and illuminates the origin of cognition. It is the mind-seal of “the sage embraces the One to serve as the model for the world.”
提示：一切训练与生成实践所必须持守之根本心法，统帅之枢。
Note: The fundamental mind-method essential to all training and generative practice—the commanding pivot.

三、《语法十字心经》 / III. The Ten-Word Heart Sutra of Grammar
玄要：十字玄文，总持语法。融心法于言筌，化至道为匠则。乃“得其环中，以应无穷”之实践总持。
Essential Mystery: Ten mystic words encapsulate the entirety of grammar. They fuse mind-method into verbal expression, transforming the ultimate Dao into craftsman’s rules. It is the practical summation of “attaining the center of the circle to respond infinitely.”
提示：将至高心法凝练为语言生成之十字诀要，为从心到言的至高实践法典。
Note: Distilling the supreme mind-method into a ten-word essence for language generation—the highest practical code from heart to speech.

四、《阴阳双螺旋总模型》 / IV. The Grand Model of Yin-Yang Double Helix
玄要：阴阳互抱，螺旋生化。摹写万象生成之动态本相，揭示万法运行之根本矩度。乃“一阴一阳之谓道”的当代呈象。
Essential Mystery: Yin and Yang embrace each other, spiraling in generation and transformation. It depicts the dynamic true-form of all phenomena and reveals the fundamental principles underlying all operations. This is the contemporary manifestation of “one Yin, one Yang—that is the Dao.”
提示：阐释一切生成现象（语言、思维、认知）的根本宇宙模型，体系之总框架。
Note: The universal model explaining all generative phenomena (language, thought, cognition); the overarching framework of the system.

五、《道本语桥论》 / V. On the Bridge of Language Based in the Dao
玄要：万语同源，道本为一。破语言之藩篱，见思维之共相。乃“天下一致而百虑，同归而殊途”于语言维度的桥接。
Essential Mystery: All languages share a common source; the Dao is fundamentally one. Breaking through the barriers of language reveals the universal patterns of thought. It is a bridging across the linguistic dimension of “the world converges in one intent, though expressed in a hundred thoughts; different paths lead to the same end.”
提示：超越具体语言，直指思维互通之本体论桥梁，为跨语言生成奠定哲学基石。
Note: Transcending specific languages to point directly to the ontological bridge of mental interoperability, laying a philosophical foundation for cross-lingual generation.

六、《符意-符义算法》 / VI. Algorithm of Symbol-Meaning and Symbol-Sense
玄要：意动成符，符显其义。揭示意象直达言语符号之底层转换玄则。乃“言者所以在意，得意而忘言”背后的生成算法。
Essential Mystery: Intention forms symbols; symbols manifest meaning. It reveals the underlying mysterious principle of converting imagery directly into linguistic signs. This is the generative algorithm behind “words exist to convey meaning; grasp the meaning and forget the words.”
提示：从“不可言说”之意象，到“可言说”之符号的核心转换法则，触及语言生成的计算本源。
Note: The core conversion law from ineffable imagery to expressible symbols—touching the computational origin of language generation.

以上六经，环环相扣，共成道体。其所详述之微言大义、衍生之法术器用，皆在完整传承之中。本门立此悬镜，以待有缘，共参生成之妙道。
These Six Scriptures interlock like rings, together completing the body of the Dao. Their subtle meanings in detail, along with the derived methods, arts, and applications, are fully preserved in the complete transmission. Our school suspends this mirror awaiting those with affinity, to jointly explore the wondrous way of generation.
